<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
<p>In CS2, two teams—the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists—compete in rounds to complete objectives like planting or defusing a bomb. Each player can earn in-game money based on their performance, which can be used to purchase weapons, armor, and other equipment in subsequent rounds, adding a layer of strategy and economy management to each match.</p>
<h2 id="storyline">Storyline</h2>
<p>CS2, like previous entries, has no traditional storyline but instead focuses on multiplayer tactical combat scenarios. Players face off in various maps and settings, such as urban environments, desert towns, and industrial complexes, representing global counter-terrorism and terrorism conflicts.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>CS2’s unique appeal lies in its precision-based gameplay, tactical complexity, and high skill ceiling. The game emphasizes teamwork, strategic planning, and individual skill, making each match feel competitive and rewarding. The transition to Valve’s Source 2 engine has also improved graphics, animations, and environmental physics.</p>
